#### Commands Not Working
- Ensure you have the required permission level for admin commands
- Check that the mod is properly loaded in the server
- Verify command syntax using `/indvspakhelp`

#### Configuration Changes Not Applied
- Use `/indvspakconfig reload` to reload configuration
- Restart the server if configuration reload doesn't work
- Check configuration file syntax for JSON errors

### Performance Considerations

- Region protection checks are optimized for minimal performance impact
- Statistics are stored in memory and periodically saved to disk
- Chat modifications use efficient event handling

### Compatibility
